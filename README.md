# BUTTERFLY🦋🦋🦋🦋

🦋I used the DCGAN tutorial on the tensorflow official website to complete the training, using a butterfly dataset I made myself, and the pictures came from pinterest and the butterfly and moth dataset.

🦋I want to make DCGAN generate new butterfly pictures by learning pictures of butterflies. Some butterfly illustrations and specimens are also included in the data set for DCGAN to learn together.

🦋If you want to run this notebook, just drag and drop the butterfly dataset zip file to the content folder in colab.
