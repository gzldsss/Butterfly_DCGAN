At the beginning, I wanted to import the dataset into the style transfer model, but only one by one.

I also tried arbitrary-image-stylization-inceptionv3, trying to optimize the images it generates, and import the local style image into the modelbut failed. Because the error shows that the dimensions of the local style image and the content image are not the same, it still cannot run after adjustment.
